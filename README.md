# Interactive Map
### Impact Hack 2020 Submission
### Made by Mena Hassan, Elizabeth Sinyavin, Thong Do, and Ruth Fedkade
#### The map displays all the US Embassies and Consulates. Users can click on each embassy/consulate marker to learn more about it, play the primary language of that country, and see the top 3 current news headlines in that country. Users can also explore our data maps, which vizualize several global issues on a world map, including population, human development index, human trafficking, and air pollution. This project was designed for use in the National Museum of American Diplomacy.
