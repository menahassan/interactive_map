# Interactive Map
### Impact Hack 2020 Submission
### Made by Mena Hassan, Elizabeth Sinyavin, Thong Do, and Ruth Fedkade
#### The map displays all the US Embassies and Consulates. Users can click on each embassy/consulate marker to learn more about it, play the primary language of that country, and see the top 3 current news headlines in that country. Users can also explore our data maps, which vizualize several global issues on a world map, including population, human development index, human trafficking, and air pollution. This includes an animation of the progression of each of these issues throughout the years, individual data maps for each year, and the ability to see more detailed information about a certain country when clicking or hovering over it. This project was designed for use in the National Museum of American Diplomacy.
