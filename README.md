map/views.py - renders html template 
map/templates/map/index.html - html to be rendered
map/news.py - uses the GoogleNews module to search the web for news

With both interactive and non-interactive elements, we hope our project will be useful for the museum. 
Highlights: 
- US diplomatic presence visualization: indicates where we do and don't have a diplomatic presence
- global issue data visualization
- web scraping to find news articles about:
  1) the US's relations with each country
  2) current events pertaining to relevant global issues
- automated non-interactive design (freestyle feature)
- audio effects
- time lapse on certain global issues

How our project can be developed further:
- improved news searching with textual analysis (e.g. regular expressions)
- improved "freestyle" feature
- adding images to popups (e.g. flags)
- adding more data-driven global issues to the drop-down menu
